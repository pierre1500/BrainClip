# Introduction to Neural Networks

## Summary

This fictional article provides a high-level overview of neural networks, explaining how artificial neurons are connected in layers and how the backpropagation algorithm enables learning from examples.

## Key Points

- Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers
- The input layer receives data, hidden layers process it, and the output layer produces results
- Backpropagation adjusts connection weights based on prediction errors
- Deep learning refers to networks with many hidden layers
- Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems

## Notes

### What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational model inspired by biological neural systems. It consists of:

1. **Input Layer** — Receives raw data (pixels, text, numbers)
2. **Hidden Layers** — Transform data through weighted connections
3. **Output Layer** — Produces the final prediction or classification

### How Learning Works

The network learns by:

- Making predictions on training data
- Comparing predictions to actual values (calculating loss)
- Adjusting weights using gradient descent
- Repeating until accuracy improves

### Key Takeaway

> Neural networks are powerful function approximators that can learn complex patterns from data when given sufficient examples and computational resources.

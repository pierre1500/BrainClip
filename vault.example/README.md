# Example Vault

This folder contains **synthetic demo notes** to illustrate the BrainClip note format.

These notes are 100% fictional and safe to commit. They demonstrate:
- YAML frontmatter structure
- Note organization by domain
- Markdown formatting used by BrainClip

## Usage

Copy this folder to `vault/` to bootstrap your local vault:

```bash
cp -r vault.example vault
```

Or simply start clipping — BrainClip will create `vault/` automatically.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The `vault/` folder is git-ignored by default. Your personal notes stay local.
